                        Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a
                        natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But
                        specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised

                        Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study 
                        , it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that 
                        contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create 
                        your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with 
                        herbal tea or warm water and lemon.

                    <p>
                        Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey 
                        may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that 
                        have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans 
                        have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.

                            Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol

                            Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its 
                            antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help
                            stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. 
                            This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get 
                            dehydrated and die off.

                        change out to honey. I feel more assure that MTA honey valley is
                        of the purest form as I have seen the GMPs employed by this

                            until I tried MTA Honey Valley. The quality of Honey Valley's
                            honey is second to none. Ever since I tried the first bottle I have
